# [Problem 6 — Sum square difference](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

<p align="center">1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385</p>

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

<p align="center">(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025</p>

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
